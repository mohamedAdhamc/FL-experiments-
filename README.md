# Repository Overview

This repository is built to track the code for experiments made on various FL algorithms utilizing the Flower framework. It is built on top of the flower quickstart pytorch guide, and there should generally be separate branches for each different FL algorithm. The main branch here being for FedAvg, the baseline algorithm. 

Other branches/algorithms

- Fedprox
- Scaffold


# Federated Learning with PyTorch and Flower (Quickstart Example)

This introductory example to Flower uses PyTorch, but deep knowledge of PyTorch is not necessarily required to run the example. However, it will help you understand how to adapt Flower to your use case. Running this example in itself is quite easy. This example uses [Flower Datasets](https://flower.ai/docs/datasets/) to download, partition and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Set up the project

### Fetch the app

Install Flower:

```shell
pip install flwr
```

Fetch the app:

```shell
flwr new @flwrlabs/quickstart-pytorch
```

This will create a new directory called `quickstart-pytorch` with the following structure:

```shell
quickstart-pytorch
├── pytorchexample
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── client_app.py   # Defines your ClientApp
│   ├── server_app.py   # Defines your ServerApp
│   └── task.py         # Defines your model, training and data loading
├── pyproject.toml      # Project metadata like dependencies and configs
└── README.md
```

### Install dependencies and project

Install the dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml` as well as the `pytorchexample` package.

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Run the project

You can run your Flower project in both _simulation_ and _deployment_ mode without making changes to the code. If you are starting with Flower, we recommend you using the _simulation_ mode as it requires fewer components to be launched manually. By default, `flwr run` will make use of the Simulation Engine.

### Run with the Simulation Engine

> [!TIP]
> This example runs faster when the `ClientApp`s have access to a GPU. Check the [Simulation Engine documentation](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/how-to-run-simulations.html) to learn more about Flower simulations and how to optimize them.

```bash
# Run with the default federation (CPU only)
flwr run .  --stream
```

You can also override some of the settings for your `ClientApp` and `ServerApp` defined in `pyproject.toml`. For example:

```bash
flwr run . --run-config "num-server-rounds=5 learning-rate=0.05"  --stream
```
